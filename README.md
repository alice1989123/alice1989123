👋 Hi, I’m Alice (Alicia Basilio Velázquez)

I build data + AI systems and the cloud infrastructure to ship them reliably.

**What I work on**
- AI / ML engineering (time-series, NLP, automation)
- Data engineering (ETL pipelines, streaming, analytics)
- Cloud & DevOps (AWS, containers, CI/CD, observability)
- Blockchain & cryptography (research + side projects)

**Current focus**
- Production-grade pipelines on AWS (serverless + container platforms)
- MLOps and deployment patterns for real systems
- Security-minded architecture (IAM, networking, governance)

**Collaboration**
I’m open to collaborations on:
- data/ML platforms
- automation & DevOps tooling
